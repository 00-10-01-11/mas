   Microsoft Activation Scripts (MAS):

   It is a collection of scripts for activating Microsoft products, these scripts are mostly a fork
   of other honourable developer's tools and scripts.

   This project consists of the following three activation methods:

   * HWID Activation       - Windows 10
   * KMS38 Activation      - Windows 10 /Server
   * Online KMS Activation - Windows /Server /Office

   The primary focus of this project is the following features:

   * Open-source.
   * Batch scripts for better transparency.
   * Clean from antivirus detections (*As much as possible, but it's not completely clean).
   * Easy to use.
