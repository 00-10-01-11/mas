   **Microsoft Activation Scripts (MAS):**

   A collection of scripts for activating Microsoft products using HWID / KMS38 / Online KMS activation methods 
   with a focus on open-source code, less antivirus detection and user-friendliness.

   * Online KMS Activation - Windows /Server /Office

   The primary focus of this project is the following features:

   * Batch scripts for better transparency.
   * Clean from antivirus detections (*As much as possible, but it's not completely clean).
   * Easy to use.
